# jupyter notebooks

These notebooks contain documentation and tutorials to learn about 
how to build BlueSky Flyers and to implement the Flyer interface
for APS fly scans that are triggered by the busy record.  There are
other fly scans at the APS, such as with the sscan record.  Here,
we focus on the busy fly scan model.
