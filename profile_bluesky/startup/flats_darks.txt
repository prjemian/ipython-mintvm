Hi Pete,

 If you look at the monaLayout.xml line 3
<global name="detector_data_destination" ndattribute="SaveDest"></global>
 ‘detector_data_destination” is a hardcoded name in the source that determines where to save new frames coming in. Here it is set to an ndattribute called SaveDest. 

If we look for SaveDest in the monaDetectorAttributes.xml file we find it at line 24
<Attribute name="SaveDest"                      type="EPICS_PV"     source="2bmbPG3:cam1:FrameType"                     dbrtype="DBR_STRING”/>

This ndattribute comes from an EPICS_PV which is the IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType and is sent over as a DRB_STRING. So basically the String representation of this PV is where you want to save the data in the hdf5 file. This string has to match the layout in monaLayout.xml . So looking at monaLayout.xml we have a group called exchange and in that group we have data, data_dark, and data_white for frame data. So if I want new frames to be saved to data_white I would have to set the string rep of FrameType to be /exchange/data_white . If it want it to save back to data I would set it to /exchange/data . 

In the legacy TXM setup, FrameType was used to determine if it is Data, Data_white or Data_dark frame. This PV is an enum with possible values of 0, 1, or 2. The string representation of these values follow: 
IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType.ZRST = data
IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType.ONST = data_dark
IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType.TWST = data_white

So to keep the same logic as the legacy TXM at 32IDC and 2-BM we change the string to be the location in the hdf5 dataset
caput for 
IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType.ZRST = /exchange/data
IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType.ONST = /exchange/data_dark
IOC_PREFIX:cam1:FrameType.TWST = /exchange/data_white
# make sure to put these in autosave so they are restored when IOC is restarted!

This way when the scan application changes FrameType to 1 it will send the new string save destination to the hdf5 writer and know where to write the frame. 

Any PV can be used, we just stuck with FrameType because it was an available PV in all AD IOC’s.

Thanks,
Arthur
